			<th-page-header>Release Version 1.0.0 (Latest: 1.1.1)</th-page-header>
			<th-content-group>
				<th-text> The following changes were made in version 1.0.0 of Thunderous: </th-text>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text>
								Added SSR support using <th-code>onServerDefine()</th-code> and <th-code>insertTemplates()</th-code>.
							</th-text>
							<th-text>
								This also prompted <th-code>clientCallback()</th-code> to handle code that would throw errors in a
								server environment.
							</th-text>
							<th-link href="/docs/server-side-rendering">Read more about server-side rendering.</th-link>
						</th-content-group>
					</li>
					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text>
								Added the
								<th-link
									href="https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/blob/master/packages/scoped-custom-element-registry"
									>scoped custom element registry polyfill</th-link
								>
								directly to the library, instead of relying on a peer dependency.
							</th-text>
							<th-text>
								This was done to ensure that the polyfill does not
								<th-link href="https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/issues/601">
									interfere with server-side rendering </th-link
								>. The polyfill is only loaded when the library is imported in a browser environment.
							</th-text>
						</th-content-group>
					</li>
					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text> Updated the methods returned by <th-code>createRegistry()</th-code>. </th-text>
							<th-text>
								Previously, <th-code>RegistryResult</th-code> exposed a <th-code>register()</th-code> method that was
								mostly unnecessary (and undocumented.) This method has been removed, and the return type now only
								exposes a <th-code>define()</th-code> method to better reflect the native behavior of custom elements.
							</th-text>
							<th-link href="/docs/registries">Read more about registries.</th-link>
						</th-content-group>
					</li>
					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text>
								Added support for
								<th-link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomElementRegistry/define#options">
									<th-code>ElementDefinitionOptions</th-code>
								</th-link>
								in <th-code>ElementResult.define()</th-code>. This is also reflected in the new
								<th-code>RegistryResult.define()</th-code> method.
							</th-text>
						</th-content-group>
					</li>
					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text>
								The <th-code>html</th-code> and <th-code>css</th-code> template tags no longer stringify all
								interpolated values. If a non-primitive is found, an error is logged to the console, and the value is
								replaced by an empty string.
							</th-text>
							<th-text>
								This change should help sniff out bugs in your code, as it's likely that you didn't intend to pass a
								non-primitive value to the template tag. This may happen when you forget to destructure a signal, for
								example.
							</th-text>
						</th-content-group>
					</li>
					<li>
						<th-content-group>
							<th-text>
								Removed the <th-link href="https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify">DOMPurify</th-link> dependency.
							</th-text>
							<th-text>
								A bug was preventing it from working properly, and upon fixing it, custom elements and slot tags were
								being stripped from the DOM. While not impossible to fix, it may not have been the best approach anyway,
								as sanitization is only necessary when rendering user-generated content.
							</th-text>
							<th-text>
								It was determined that the concern should instead lie with the component author, as is normally the case
								for native web components.
