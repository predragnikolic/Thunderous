				<th-content-header>How To Bind</th-content-header>
				<th-text>
					To bind signals to a template, use the provided <th-code>html</th-code> tagged template function to pass them
					in. By binding signals to templates, you allow fine-grained updates to be made directly to DOM nodes every
					time the signal changes, without requiring any diffing or re-rendering.
				</th-text>
				<th-text> Currently, binding is only supported in attribute values and text content. </th-text>
				<th-code-block lang="ts"><%= include('_code-snippets/binding-signals.ejs') %></th-code-block>
				<th-text>
					Notice we are not <em>running</em> the signal's getter above. This is intentional, as that responsibility is
					delegated to the template for proper binding.
					<em>If you run the getter yourself, the template will not update when the signal changes.</em>

				<th-content-header>How To Remove Attributes</th-content-header>
				<th-text>
					Sometimes, setting an attribute to false is not sufficient, and the entire attribute must be added or removed.
					To remove an attribute, set the value to <th-code>null</th-code>. To add it back, you can set it to an empty
					string.

						<th-text>
							Binding also works in the
							<th-link href="/docs/adopted-style-sheets"><th-code>css</th-code> tagged template function</th-link>, but
							doing so may have a limited use case. For best performance, the suggested approach is to create a
							<th-code>CSSStyleSheet</th-code> outside the component, then adopt the style sheet inside the component
							and toggle classes in the HTML. Signals bound to these style sheets will reflect across all instances of
							the same component, not just the current one.
						</th-text>
						<th-text>
							That said, if you're not concerned with incurring performance overhead, you may create a new
							<th-code>CSSStyleSheet</th-code> for each instance of the component. The difference is simply defining the
							style sheet inside the component function, rather than outside.
